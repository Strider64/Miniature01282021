# An Active Record Design Pattern
My Main Website based off a tutorial that I am following, but switching from mysqli to PDO as I feel that is 
a much cleaner way of implementating and easier. I still have ways to go, but once I'm finish my classes should
be easier to transferred from one project to another project.
