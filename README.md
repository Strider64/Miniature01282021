# Website Development & Design
Created by John Pepp on February 1, 2020

Redoing my whole website to bring it up-to-date with the latest practices
and methods. It will feature a Content Management System (CMS) that will feature
the capability to upload/resize images. The website uses PHP with 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Vanilla JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS3 using grids.


# An Active Record Design Pattern
My Main Website based off a tutorial that I am following, but switching from mysqli to PDO as I feel that is 
a much cleaner way of implementation and easier. I still have ways to go, but once I'm finish my classes should
be easier to transferred from one project to another project.
